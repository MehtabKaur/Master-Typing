      <h1 class="heading">Getting started with touch typing</h1>
      <p>
        Getting started with touch typing can be intimidating, even though the basics are quite simple. <br>
        An important starting point to properly touch type is your sitting posture for typing. Many typists are not aware of the importance of their sitting posture, which can have an impact on their overall health and typing.

        Here are some great tips from <a href=" https://www.ratatype.com/learn/">Ratatype</a> that should be put into action when you are typing.
          <ul>
            <li class="posture-tip">Sit straight and remember to keep your back straight.</li>
            <li class="posture-tip">Keep your elbows bent at the right angle.</li>
            <li class="posture-tip">Face the screen with your head slightly tilted forward.</li>
            <li class="posture-tip">Keep at least 45 - 70 cm of distance between your eyes and the screen.</li>
            <li class="posture-tip">Expose the shoulder, arm, and wrist muscles to the least possible strain. The wrists can touch the tabletop in front of the keyboard. Never shift your body weight to the wrists by resting on them.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Below is a diagram to illustrate what your sitting posture should look like when you are typing.</p>

        As described in the <a href="home.html">What is touch typing</a> section, it is important to position your fingers correctly on the keyboard and
        remember which finger is assigned to which key on the keyboard in order to touch type effectively.
        <br> Using the raised bar or dot on the ‘”F” and “J” keys is also very beneficial when learning to touch type as it allows you to move your fingers back to the correct position without having to look down at the keyboard.
      </p>

      <p>Listed below are the basic movements of the left and right fingers when typing to help you get started:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="keys">Left pinky finger – for typing keys <kbd class="key">Q</kbd>, <kbd class="key">A</kbd>, <kbd class="key">Z</kbd> and <kbd class="key">left Shift</kbd></li>
        <li class="keys">Left ring finger – for typing keys <kbd class="key">W</kbd>, <kbd class="key">S</kbd> and <kbd class="key">X</kbd></li>
        <li class="keys">Left middle finger – for typing keys <kbd class="key">E</kbd>, <kbd class="key">D</kbd> and <kbd class="key">C</kbd></li>
        <li class="keys">Left index finger – for typing keys <kbd class="key">R</kbd>, <kbd class="key">F</kbd>, <kbd class="key">V</kbd>, <kbd class="key">T</kbd>, <kbd class="key">G</kbd> and <kbd class="key">B</kbd></li>
        <li class="keys">Right index finger – for typing keys <kbd class="key">Y</kbd>, <kbd class="key">H</kbd>, <kbd class="key">N</kbd>, <kbd class="key">U</kbd>, <kbd class="key">J</kbd> and <kbd class="key">M</kbd> </li>
        <li class="keys">Right middle finger – for typing keys <kbd class="key">I</kbd>, <kbd class="key">K</kbd> and <kbd class="key">,</kbd></li>
        <li class="keys">Right ring finger – for typing keys <kbd class="key">O</kbd>, <kbd class="key">L</kbd> and <kbd class="key">.</kbd></li>
        <li class="keys">Right pinky finger – for typing keys <kbd class="key">P</kbd>, <kbd class="key">;</kbd>, <kbd class="key">?</kbd>, <kbd class="key">{</kbd>, <kbd class="key">}</kbd>, <kbd class="key">Enter</kbd> and
          <kbd class="key">right Shift</kbd>
        </li>
        <li class="keys">Both right and left thumb – for pressing the Spacebar</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While the basic principles of touch typing are easy to understand, a lot of practice is required to build muscle memory when typing and master the skill of touch typing. </p>
